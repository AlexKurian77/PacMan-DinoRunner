# Pacman & Dino Runner 🎮

A sweet project that lets you **choose between two classic games** – **Pac-Man** and **Dino Runner** – from a single launcher app. Built with C# and Java like the dream team they are. 🤝

## 🚀 How to Start

To run this masterpiece, start from the **`game-selector`** folder. That’s the control hub of the operation.

Then just run the selector and pick your game. Easy as Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.

## 🕹️ How to Play the games

1. Inside it, make sure the **path to the games** are correct in the launcher code.
   Change the path if your folder structure is different, or if you've got the game in another location.

2. Select **the game** in the launcher.

3. Play and Enjoy the games

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **C#** – Handles the core game logic and visuals. Powers the game selector interface and launches the games.
- **JAVA - Spring Boot** – Used for backend stuff like score tracking.

---

Make sure the launcher knows where the other two games are — update those paths if needed!

## 🛠️ Notes
The overall project includes gesture controls, but in this setup, we’re just running the games normally.

You can extend the selector to include more games. Add Tetris? Flappy Bird? Doom? You’re the boss here.

Make it pretty with a GUI if you feel spicy.
